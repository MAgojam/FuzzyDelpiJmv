# Fuzzy Delphi Module for Jamovi
## Background
The fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) is a modified version of the classical Delphi technique that applies fuzzy set theory to handle the ambiguity and vagueness in expert opinions. Jamovi is an open source statistical software that is user-friendly and based on R programming language. The project investigates the evolution of a FDM module that has been incorporated into Jamovi and explores its potential uses and benefits.
